## 👨🏻‍💻 Hello everyone, we made some changes here


To make this project more organized, we added the DAO (Data Access Object), which is a standard for applications that use data persistence, where there is a separation of business rules and rules for accessing the database, implemented with MVC architecture, where all Bank Functionalities such as obtaining connections, mapping objects to SQL data types or executing SQL commands, where it must be done by DAO classes.

Like the description, this is a system developed for educational purposes, requested by the Federal Institute of Sergipe as a form of bimonthly assessment. In this way, it is emphasized in this document that the name of the application is only fictitious to name the "company" for which "we are developing". 😅😊
